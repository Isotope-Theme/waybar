# Isotope Theme for [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)

## Install

### Managed (Recommended)

If this program has a plugin manager, prefer to use that. It will keep the theme up to date. Otherwise, use the automated installer.

### Automated

To use the automated installer, just run

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Isotope-Theme/waybar/master/install.sh)
```

This script will download the necessary files, and install the theme into your configuration. For some programs this installer will add the theme to your plugin manager.

### Manual

For manual installation, just copy the necessary files from this repository and install them in whatever way you see fit.
